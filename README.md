# Goldfish
Third Project for WDI-9

## Project-Overview

Our application is a collection of hosted applications and tools for developers. On our site we have a collection of developer apps and tools each one having a descriptipn nad links to downloads and documentation. A user can log in and store their favorite tools on their User Page. With this user have access to all of their favorite and commonly used tools for download and documentation references. For example if a user were to start working on a new computer they would have links to all of their tools they need to download on their machine as well as links to the set up. Users can freely edit their account information as well as their favorites list. As well as user authentication and password hashing through bcrypt.nodejs. This is a full MEAN stack application.
